# Spotify-Modern-Record-Player
I am new to coding and have learned some basic python. I am looking to do a fun project and build some more experience. As part of a valentines day gift for my girlfriend, I'm looking to create a sort of modern day record player with sentimental albums. She was disappointed that my record player setup wouldn't fit in her place, so this would be fun. I'm pretty clueless on where to start aside from grabbing a RFID kit and rasberry pi. Would love some assistance from you smart people. Here's the video inspiration for reference.  https://vm.tiktok.com/TTPdh5tQRS/
